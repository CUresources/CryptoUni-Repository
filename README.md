# CryptoUNI Repository

CryptoUNI™ is a partnership between local educational institutions in Singapore with the aim of fostering and expanding the knowledge of blockchain and cryptocurrencies amongst students, who are the future knowledge workers in this area. Not solely restricting to the spreading of awareness, we also aim to build networks to help one another grow in this early stage of blockchain adoption. For those interested in developing the touch for blockchain programming, CryptoUNI™ also has connections to students and  professionals actively working and doing research in this area.

The resources held in this open repository and links to external media hosting platforms serve as references for members under the CryptoUNI™ collaborative initiative to keep up on latest trends, guidelines and information exchange where relevant.
